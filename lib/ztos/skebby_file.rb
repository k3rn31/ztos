# This script retrieves the contacts form ZohoCRM using the API and generates
# multiple CSV files in the format that Skebby likes.
# The script gets the ZohoCRM authorization token from an environment variable,
# then it retrieves a JSON list of clients, and converts it in a Hash.
# Last, it converts it to multiple CSV files, one for each 'Lead Source'.

# The class defining the CSV to import on Skebby
class SkebbyFile < File
  # Creates a file that when initializes, adds a header.
  #
  # Arguments:
  #   filename: (String)
  #   mode: (String)

  def initialize(filename, mode)
    super(filename, mode)
    # Every time we create a ne file, we insert
    # the CSV header in the Skebby format.
    # Again we only use the columns we need.
    puts 'nome;cognome;email;numero di cellulare'
